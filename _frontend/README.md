## File Descriptions

Let's go through each significant file and folder in the project:

### `components`

- **Breadcrumb.tsx**: This component is responsible for rendering breadcrumbs on the top of pages, indicating the current location within the app.

- **Loader.tsx**: It renders a loading spinner or indicator to inform users that content is being loaded.

- **TaskChart.tsx**: This component appears to be related to rendering charts for tasks.

- **TaskList.tsx**: TaskList component renders a list of tasks. It is likely used in the task management section of the app.

### `context`

- **AuthContext.tsx**: This context provides authentication-related state and functions, likely used for user authentication throughout the app.

- **TaskProvider.tsx**: TaskProvider appears to provide context related to task management.

### `hooks`

- **useAxios.ts**: Custom hook for making HTTP requests using Axios.

- **useTaskContext.ts**: Custom hook for accessing task-related context data.

### `images`

This folder likely contains image assets used in the application.

### `interfaces`

- **Task.ts**: Defines an interface for a Task object.

### `layout`

- **DefaultLayout.tsx**: This component represents the default layout of the application, which likely includes common elements like navigation bars or footers.

### `pages`

This folder contains different pages or views of the application.

- **Authentication**: Contains pages for user authentication (SignIn.tsx and SignUp.tsx).

- **Dashboard**: Contains the main dashboard page (Home.tsx).

- **LandingPage.tsx**: The landing page of the application, possibly the entry point for visitors.

- **Pet.tsx**: A page related to "Pet" management, though the exact functionality is not clear from the code.

- **Profile.tsx**: A page for user profiles.

- **Settings.tsx**: A page for user settings.

- **TaskManager.tsx**: The main page for task management, including a calendar view and task lists.

### `routes`

- **index.ts**: Defines routes for various pages and components within the application.

### `axios.ts`

This file configures an Axios instance for making HTTP requests. It sets the base URL for API requests depending on the environment (development or production).

### `index.css` and `satoshi.css`

These CSS files define styles used throughout the application. They include custom styles as well as styles for third-party libraries.

### `lib.d.ts`

A TypeScript declaration file that allows importing image files (PNG, SVG, JPEG, JPG) without type errors.

### `main.tsx`

The main entry point of the React application. It sets up the ReactDOM rendering and includes routing and authentication providers.

### `react-app-env.d.ts`

A TypeScript declaration file for handling various image file types (PNG, SVG, JPEG, JPG) in the React application.

## Project Functionality

From the code and folder structure, it appears that the project is a web application built with React for managing tasks and includes user authentication. The app has various pages, including a landing page, task management, user profile, settings, and pet management (though the exact functionality of this part is unclear). Users can sign in and sign up, and there's a dashboard for managing tasks, potentially with a calendar view and task lists.

## Installation and Usage

To set up and run the project, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
3. Navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
6. Open your web browser and access the application at the specified URL.
